steps:
  - step: 1
    status: trivial
    desc: >
      Let connection be a newly created RTCPeerConnection object.

  - step: 2
    status: tested
    files:
      - RTCCertificate
    desc: >
      If the certificates value in configuration is non-empty, check that the
      expires on each value is in the future. If a certificate has expired,
      throw an InvalidAccessError; otherwise, store the certificates.

  - step: 2
    status: untestable
    desc: >
      If no certificates value was specified, one or more new RTCCertificate
      instances are generated for use with this RTCPeerConnection instance.

  - step: 2
    status: untestable
    desc: >
      This MAY happen asynchronously and the value of certificates remains
      undefined for the subsequent steps.

  - step: 3
    status: tested
    files:
      - RTCConfiguration-rtcpMuxPolicy
    desc: >
      If configuration.rtcpMuxPolicy is negotiate, and the user agent does not
      implement non-muxed RTCP, throw a NotSupportedError.

  - step: 4
    status: untestable
    desc: >
      Initialize connection's ICE Agent.

  - step: 5
    status: tested
    desc: >
      Set the configuration specified by configuration.

  - step: 6
    status: tested
    files:
      - RTCPeerConnection-constructor
    desc: >
      Let connection have an [[isClosed]] internal slot, initialized to false.

  - step: 7
    status: tested
    files:
      - RTCPeerConnection-constructor
    desc: >
      Let connection have a [[needNegotiation]] internal slot, initialized to
      false.

  - step: 8
    status: tested
    files:
      - RTCSctpTransport-constructor
    desc: >
      Let connection have an [[sctpTransport]] internal slot, initialized to null.

  - step: 9
    status: untestable
    desc: >
      Let connection have an [[operations]] internal slot, representing an
      operations queue, initialized to an empty list.

  - step: 10
    status: tested
    files:
      RTCPeerConnection-constructor
    desc: >
      Set connection's signaling state to stable.

  - step: 11
    status: tested
    files:
      RTCPeerConnection-constructor
    desc: >
      Set connection's ICE connection state to new.

  - step: 12
    status: tested
    files:
      RTCPeerConnection-constructor
    desc: >
      Set connection's ICE gathering state to new.

  - step: 13
    status: tested
    files:
      RTCPeerConnection-constructor
    desc: >
      Set connection's connection state to new.

  - step: 14
    status: tested
    files:
      RTCPeerConnection-constructor
    desc: >
      Set connection's pendingLocalDescription, currentLocalDescription,
      pendingRemoteDescription and currentRemoteDescription to null.

  - step: 15
    status: trivial
    desc: >
      Return connection.
