      offerToReceiveAudio

      When this is given a non-false value, no outgoing track of type "audio"
      is attached to the PeerConnection, and the existing localDescription
      (if any) doesn't contain any sendrecv or recv audio media sections,
      createOffer() will behave as if addTransceiver("audio") had been called
      once prior to the createOffer() call.

      In all other situations, it will be disregarded.
