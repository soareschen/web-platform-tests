      offerToReceiveAudio

      Whenever this is given a non-false value, and the RTCPeerConnection has no
      non-stopped "sendrecv" or "recvonly" audio transceivers, createOffer()
      MUST as its first step invoke the equivalent of addTransceiver("audio") on
      the RTCPeerConnection object, except that this MUST NOT Update the
      negotiation-needed flag, and, provided this does not fail, proceed with
      createOffer()'s regular steps.

      In all other situations, it will be disregarded.
