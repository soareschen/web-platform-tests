      To create an RTCRtpReceiver with kind, kind, and optionally an id string,
      id, run the following steps.
    steps:
      - step: 1
        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Let receiver be a new RTCRtpReceiver object.

      - step: 2
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Let track be a new MediaStreamTrack object [GETUSERMEDIA]. The source
          of track is a remote source provided by receiver.

      - step: 3
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Initialize track.kind to kind.

      - step: 4
        status: todo
        desc: >
          If an id string, id, was given as input to this algorithm, initialize
          track.id to id. (Otherwise the value generated when track was created
          will be used.)

      - step: 5
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Initialize track.label to the result of concatenating the string
          "remote " with kind.

      - step: 6
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Initialize track.readyState to live.

      - step: 7
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Initialize track.muted to true. See the MediaStreamTrack section about
          how the muted attribute reflects if a MediaStreamTrack is receiving
          media data or not.

      - step: 8
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Let receiver have a [[ReceiverTrack]] internal slot initialized to
          track.

      - step: 9
        status: todo
        desc: >
          Let receiver have a [[ReceiverTransport]] internal slot initialized to
          null.

      - step: 10
        status: todo
        desc: >
          Let receiver have a [[ReceiverRtcpTransport]] internal slot
          initialized to null.

      - step: 11
        status: todo
        desc: >
          Let receiver have an [[AssociatedRemoteMediaStreams]] internal slot,
          representing a list of MediaStream objects that the MediaStreamTrack
          object of this receiver is associated with, and initialized to an
          empty list.

      - step: 12
        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Return receiver.
