      To create an RTCRtpTransceiver with an RTCRtpReceiver object, receiver,
      RTCRtpSender object, sender, and an RTCRtpTransceiverDirection value,
      direction, run the following steps.
    steps:
      - step: 1
        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Let transceiver be a new RTCRtpTransceiver object.

      - step: 2

        desc: >
          Let transceiver have a [[Sender]] internal slot, initialized to sender.

          Let transceiver have a [[Receiver]] internal slot, initialized to
          receiver.

          Let transceiver have a [[Stopped]] internal slot, initialized to false.

          direction.

          Return transceiver.
