      The getReceivers method MUST return the result of executing the
      CollectReceivers algorithm.

      We define the CollectReceivers algorithm as follows.
    steps:
      - step: 1
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-getTransceivers
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Let transceivers be the result of executing the CollectTransceivers
          algorithm.

      - step: 2
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-getTransceivers
        desc: >
          Let receiverset be a new empty set.

      - step: 3
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          For each transceiver in transceivers,

          - step: 1
            status: tested
            files:
              - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
            desc: >
              Let receiver be transceiver's [[Receiver]].

          - step: 2
            status: tested
            files:
              - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
            desc: >
              Add receiver to receiverset.

      - step: 4
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Let receivers be a new sequence consisting of all the RTCRtpReceiver
          objects in receiverset. The conversion from the receivers set to the
          sequence is user agent defined and the order does not have to be
          stable between calls.

      - step: 5
        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Return receivers.
