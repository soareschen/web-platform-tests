      When the method is invoked, the user agent MUST return the result of
      setting the RTCSessionDescription indicated by the method's first argument.

      In addition, a remote description is processed to determine and verify the
      identity of the peer.

      If an a=identity attribute is present in the session description, the
      browser validates the identity assertion.

      If the "peerIdentity" configuration is applied to the RTCPeerConnection,
      this establishes a target peer identity of the provided value.

      Alternatively, if the RTCPeerConnection has previously authenticated the
      identity of the peer (that is, there is a current value for peerIdentity),
      then this also establishes a target peer identity.

      The target peer identity cannot be changed once set.

      Once set, if a different value is provided, the user agent MUST reject the
      returned promise with a newly created InvalidModificationError and abort
      this operation.

      The RTCPeerConnection MUST be closed if the validated peer identity does
      not match the target peer identity.

      If there is no target peer identity, then setRemoteDescription does not
      await the completion of identity validation.
