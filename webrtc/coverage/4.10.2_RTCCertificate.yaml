  The RTCCertificate object can be stored and retrieved from persistent storage
  by an application. When a user agent is required to obtain a structured clone
  [HTML51] of an RTCCertificate object, it performs the following steps.
steps:
  - step: 1
    status: todo
    desc: >
      Let input and memory be the corresponding inputs defined by the internal
      structured cloning algorithm, where input represents an RTCCertificate
      object to be cloned.

  - step: 2
    status: trivial
    desc: >
      Let output be a newly constructed RTCCertificate object.

  - step: 3
    status: todo
    desc: >
      Copy the value of the expires attribute from input to output.

  - step: 4
    status: todo
    desc: >
      Let the [[Certificate]] internal slot of output be set to the result of
      invoking the internal structured clone algorithm recursively on the
      corresponding internal slots of input, with the slot contents as the new
      "input" argument and memory as the new " memory" argument.

  - step: 5
    status: todo
    desc: >
      Let the [[KeyingMaterial]] internal slot of output refer to the same
      private keying material represented by the [[KeyingMaterial]] internal
      slot of input.
