      The getSenders method MUST return the result of executing the
      CollectSenders algorithm.

      We define the CollectSenders algorithm as follows.
    steps:
      - step: 1
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-getTransceivers
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Let transceivers be the result of executing the CollectTransceivers
          algorithm.

      - step: 2
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-getTransceivers
        desc: >
          Let senderset be a new empty set.

      - step: 3
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          For each transceiver in transceivers,
        steps:
          - step: 1
            files:
              - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
            desc: >
              Let sender be transceiver's [[Sender]].

          - step: 2
            files:
              - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
            desc: >
              Add sender to senderset.

      - step: 4
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-addTransceiver
        desc: >
          Let senders be a new sequence consisting of all the RTCRtpSender
          objects in senderset. The conversion from the senders set to the
          sequence is user agent defined and the order does not have to be
          stable between calls.

      - step: 5
        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Return senders.
