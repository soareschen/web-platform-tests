steps:
  - status: todo
    desc: >
      An RTCDtlsTransport has a [[DtlsTransportState]] internal slot initialized
      to new.

  - status: untestable
    desc: >
      When the underlying DTLS transport needs to update the state of the
      corresponding RTCDtlsTransport object, the user agent MUST queue a task
      that runs the following steps.
    steps:
      - step: 1
        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Let transport be the RTCDtlsTransport object to receive the state
          update.

      - step: 2
        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Let newState be the new state.

      - step: 3
        status: todo
        desc: >
          Set transport's [[DtlsTransportState]] slot to newState.

      - step: 4
        status: todo
        desc: >
          Fire a simple event named statechange at transport.
