      An RTCPeerConnection object contains a set of RTCRtpTransceivers,
      representing the paired senders and receivers with some shared state.
      This set is initialized to the empty set when the RTCPeerConnection object
      is created.

      The getTransceivers method MUST return the result of executing the
      CollectTransceivers algorithm.

      We define the CollectTransceivers algorithm as follows.
    steps:
      - step: 1
        status: tested

          - RTCPeerConnection-getTransceivers

        desc: >
          Let transceivers be a new sequence that represents a snapshot of all the
          RTCRtpTransceiver objects in this RTCPeerConnection object's set of
          transceivers. The conversion from the transceiver set to the sequence is
          user agent defined and the order does not have to be stable between
          calls.

        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Return transceivers.
