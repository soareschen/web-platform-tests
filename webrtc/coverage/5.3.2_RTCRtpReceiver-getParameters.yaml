      When getParameters is called, the RTCRtpParameters dictionary is
      constructed as follows.

          encodings is populated based on RIDs present in the current remote
          description. Every member of the RTCRtpEncodingParameters dictionaries
          other than the RID fields is left undefined.

        files:

          The headerExtensions sequence is populated based on the header
          extensions that the receiver is currently prepared to receive.

        files:

          The codecs sequence is populated based on the codecs that the receiver
          is currently prepared to receive.

      - step: 4

          rtcp.reducedSize is set to true if the receiver is currently prepared
          to receive reduced-size RTCP packets, and false otherwise. rtcp.cname
          is left undefined.
