desc: MediaStreamTrack
steps:
  - status: trivial
    desc: >
      A MediaStreamTrack object's reference to its MediaStream in the non-local
      media source case (an RTP source, as is the case for MediaStreamTracks
      received over an RTCPeerConnection) is always strong.

  - status: todo
    desc: >
      When an RTCPeerConnection receives data on an RTP source for the first
      time, it MUST update the muted state of the corresponding MediaStreamTrack
      with the value false.

  - status: todo
    desc: >
      When one of the SSRCs for RTP source media streams received by an
      RTCPeerConnection is removed (either due to reception of a BYE or via
      timeout), it MUST update the muted state of the corresponding
      MediaStreamTrack with the value true.

      If and when packets are received again, the muted state MUST be updated
      with the value false.

  - status: trivial
    desc: >
      The procedure update a track's muted state is specified in [GETUSERMEDIA].

  - status: untestable
    desc: >
      When a MediaStreamTrack track produced by an RTCRtpReceiver receiver has
      ended [GETUSERMEDIA] (such as via a call to receiver.track.stop), the user
      agent MAY choose to free resources allocated for the incoming stream, by
      for instance turning off the decoder of receiver.
