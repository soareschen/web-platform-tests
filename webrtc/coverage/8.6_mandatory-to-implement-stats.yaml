desc:  Mandatory To Implement Stats
steps:
  - status: trivial
    desc: >
      The stats listed in [WEBRTC-STATS] are intended to cover a wide range of
      use cases. Not all of them have to be implemented by every WebRTC
      implementation.

    desc: >
      An implementation MUST support generating statistics of the following
      types when the corresponding objects exist on a PeerConnection, with the
      attributes that are listed when they are valid for that object.

          RTCRTPStreamStats, with attributes ssrc, mediaType, trackId,
          transportId, codecId, nackCount

          RTCReceivedRTPStreamStats, with all required attributes from its
          inherited dictionaries, and also attributes packetsReceived,
          bytesReceived, packetsLost, jitter, packetsDiscarded

          RTCInboundRTPStreamStats, with all required attributes from its
          inherited dictionaries, and also attributes remoteId, framesDecoded

          RTCRemoteInboundRTPStreamStats, with all required attributes from its
          inherited dictionaries, and also attributes localId, roundTripTime

          RTCSentRTPStreamStats, with all required attributes from its inherited
          dictionaries, and also attributes packetsSent, bytesSent

          RTCOutboundRTPStreamStats, with all required attributes from its
          inherited dictionaries, and also attributes remoteId, framesEncoded

          RTCRemoteOutboundRTPStreamStats, with all required attributes from its
          inherited dictionaries, and also attributes localId, remoteTimestamp

          RTCPeerConnectionStats, with attributes dataChannelsOpened,
          dataChannelsClosed

          RTCDataChannelStats, with attributes label, protocol, datachannelId,
          state, messagesSent, bytesSent, messagesReceived, bytesReceived

          RTCMediaStreamStats, with attributes streamIdentifer, trackIds

          RTCMediaStreamTrackStats, with attributes trackIdentifier,
          remoteSource, ended, detached, frameWidth, frameHeight,
          framesPerSecond, framesSent, framesReceived, framesDecoded,
          framesDropped, framesCorrupted, audioLevel

          RTCCodecStats, with attributes payloadType, codec, clockRate,
          channels, sdpFmtpLine

          RTCTransportStats, with attributes bytesSent, bytesReceived,
          rtcpTransportStatsId, selectedCandidatePairId, localCertificateId,
          remoteCertificateId

          RTCIceCandidatePairStats, with attributes transportId,
          localCandidateId, remoteCandidateId, state, priority, nominated,
          bytesSent, bytesReceived, totalRoundTripTime, currentRoundTripTime

          RTCIceCandidateStats, with attributes ip, port, protocol,
          candidateType, priority, url

          RTCCertificateStats, with attributes fingerprint, fingerprintAlgorithm,
          base64Certificate, issuerCertificateId

  - status: untestable
    desc: >
      An implementation MAY support generating any other statistic defined in [WEBRTC-STATS], and MAY generate statistics that are not documented.
