desc: Protection Afforded by Media Isolation

      Media isolation ensures that the content of a MediaStreamTrack is not
      accessible to web applications. However, to ensure that media with a
      peerIdentity option set can be sent to peers, some meta-information
      about the media will be exposed to applications.

        Applications will be able to observe the parameters of the media that
        affect session negotiation and conversion into RTP. This includes the
        codecs that might be supported by the track, the bitrate, the number of
        packets, and the current settings that are set on the MediaStreamTrack.

        In particular, the statistics that RTCPeerConnection records are not
        reduced in capability. New statistics that might compromise isolation
        MUST be avoided, or explicitly suppressed for isolated streams.

        Most of these data are exposed to the network when the media is
        transmitted. Only the settings for the MediaStreamTrack present a new
        source of information. This can includes the frame rate and resolution
        of video tracks, the bandwidth of audio tracks, and other information
        about the source, which would not otherwise be revealed to a network
        observer. Since settings don't change at a high frequency or in response
        to changes in media content, settings only reveal limited reveal
        information about the content of a track. However, any setting that
        might change dynamically in response to the content of an isolated
        MediaStreamTrack MUST have changes suppressed.
