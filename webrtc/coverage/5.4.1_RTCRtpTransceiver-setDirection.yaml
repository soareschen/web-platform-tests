      Let transceiver be the RTCRtpTransceiver object on which the method is
      invoked.

  - step: 2
    status: trivial
    desc: >
      Let connection be the RTCPeerConnection object associated with transceiver.

  - step: 3
    status: todo
    desc: >
      If connection's [[IsClosed]] slot is true, throw an InvalidStateError.

  - step: 4
    status: todo
    desc: >
      If transceiver's [[Stopped]] slot is true, throw an InvalidStateError.

  - step: 5

      Let newDirection be the argument to setDirection.

      If newDirection is equal to transceiver's [[Direction]] slot, abort these
      steps.

  - step: 7
    status: tested

      Set transceiver's [[Direction]] slot to newDirection.

      Update the negotiation-needed flag for connection.
