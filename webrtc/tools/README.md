WebRTC Coverage Tools
=====================

This directory contains a simple Node.js project to do some coverage reporting
on the [coverage](../coverage) status of WPT on webrtc-pc.

Several [scripts](./scripts) are available as follow:

  - `overview.js` - Get the overall coverage break down by status.
  - `coverage-by-section.js` - Show coverage stats break down by section.
  - `show-todo` - Extract all TODO items and format as YAML at console.
